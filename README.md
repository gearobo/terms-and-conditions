Dispute Resolution:
Forum and Venue: If you are a QROFID user located in the United States or Canada, the "Special Arbitration Provision For United States Or Canada Users" section below is applicable to you, and it is essential to thoroughly review that section. If you are not subject to the "Special Arbitration Provision For United States Or Canada Users" section, you consent to the exclusive resolution of any claim or cause of action against QROFID that you may have, relating to, arising out of, or in any way connected with our Terms or our Services, as well as any claim or cause of action filed by QROFID against you. Both you and QROFID agree that such claims or causes of action, individually referred to as a "Dispute" and collectively as "Disputes," will be resolved exclusively in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, California. Furthermore, you consent to the personal jurisdiction of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or cause of action. The laws of the State of California will govern any such claim or cause of action, disregarding any conflict of law provisions. However, subject to our discretion, we may opt to resolve any Dispute not subject to arbitration in a competent court in your residing country that possesses jurisdiction over the Dispute.

Governing Law: Our Terms, as well as any Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, arising between QROFID and you, are governed by the laws of the State of California, irrespective of any conflict of law provisions.
Time Limit for Claims and Disputes: THESE TERMS ALSO IMPOSE A LIMIT ON THE TIMEFRAME WITHIN WHICH YOU CAN BRING FORTH A CLAIM OR DISPUTE, INCLUDING INITIATING AN ARBITRATION, OR IF PERMISSIBLE, COMMENCING A COURT ACTION OR SMALL CLAIMS PROCEEDING, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW. Both parties, that is, QROFID and you, concur that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes defined below), Claims, which encompass the initiation of an arbitration proceeding, must be brought within one year after the Dispute initially arose. Failure to do so will result in the permanent dismissal of such Dispute. In essence, if a Claim (including the commencement of arbitration) is not initiated within one year after the Dispute first surfaced, the arbitration will be dismissed as untimely.
