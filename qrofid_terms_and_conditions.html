This disclaimer does not modify your rights with respect to the QROFID Parties if the laws of your country or territory of residence, applicable due to your use of our Services, do not permit it. If you are a United States resident, you waive any rights you may have under California Civil Code §1542, or any other similar applicable statute or law of any other jurisdiction, which states that a general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in their favor at the time of executing the release, and that if known by them would have materially affected their settlement with the debtor or released party.</p>    <p>Limitation of Liability: The QROFID Parties will not be liable to you for any lost profits or consequential, special, punitive, indirect, or incidental damages relating to, arising out of, or in any way connected with our Terms, us, or our Services (however caused and on any theory of liability, including negligence), even if the QROFID Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability relating to, arising out of, or in any way connected with our Terms, us, or our Services will not exceed the greater of one Thausand indian rupees (1000 Rs.) or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.

If you are not subject to the "Special Arbitration Provision For United States Or Canada Users" section, you consent to the exclusive resolution of any claim or cause of action against QROFID that you may have, relating to, arising out of, or in any way connected with our Terms or our Services, as well as any claim or cause of action filed by QROFID against you.
